\begin{abstract}
COVID-19 has been regarded as a serious disaster because of the enormous influence on human society, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of social media has been increased. In this situation, the social media information can help the researchers to grasp the situational information and public reactions to this pandemic. Therefore, social media, such as Twitter, can be regarded as a valuable tool to predict the outbreak of epidemic diseases. Based on some research, AI-based NLP topic models can be used to detect the latent topics, and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), BTM (Biterm Topic Model) are said to be two potent topic models for topic extraction. In this project, we intend to propose a framework to preprocess text data then extract the potential topics by implementing topic models and apply the algorithm on the Twitter dataset related to the epidemic for further analysis.
